		<h1>💌 A Letter From My Heart 💌</h1>

		<p>To The One Who Walked Into My Quiet World,<br>
			And Made It Louder — In The Best Way Possible,</p>

		<p>You Remember That Silent, Introverted Girl I Used To Be?<br>
			The One Who Avoided Eye Contact, Kept Words Locked Inside, And Never Knew How To Take Up Space?<br>
			Well… She’s Still Here — But She Talks Now. A Lot.<br>
			Even To Strangers. And That’s Because Of You.</p>

		<p>You Didn’t Just Become My Friend.<br>
			You Became My Loudest Cheerleader, Softest Listener, And The Warmest Corner Of My Chaos.<br>
			You Believed In Me Before I Knew How To Believe In Myself.<br>
			You Gave Me The Kind Of Confidence That Doesn’t Come From Compliments —<br>
			But From Being Seen, Accepted, And Backed Every Step Of The Way.</p>

		<p>I Call You My Favorite Sirdard — Because Honestly,<br>
			Only You Have The Guts To Interrupt Me Mid-Sentence Just To Watch Me Glare.<br>
			And Then? One Look. One Innocent Face. And Everything’s Fixed.<br>
			Fooshhh — All My Anger Disappears.</p>

		<p>You Fight For Me.<br>
			You Care For Me — Even When I Push You Away.<br>
			Even When I Throw Tantrums, Act Dramatic, Or Pretend I Don’t Care…<br>
			You Stay. With Patience, With Kindness, With Love That Doesn’t Ask Me To Change.</p>

		<p>You’ve Seen My Mood Swings, My Zidd, My Childish Chaos In This Bhari Jawani —<br>
			And Yet, Here You Are… Not Once Making Me Feel Like I’m Too Much.<br>
			Instead, You Make Me Feel Like I’m Just Enough.<br>
			Exactly The Way I Am.</p>

		<p>So This Letter?<br>
			It’s Not A Thank You.<br>
			It’s A Forever.</p>

		<p>For The Version Of Me You’ve Helped Bloom,<br>
			For The Parts Of Me You Healed Without Even Knowing,<br>
			And For Every Moment That Made Us Us...</p>

		<p>You’re Not Just A Friend.<br>
			You’re My Home In A Human.</p>

		<div class="signature">With All My Love,<br>Your Not-So-Silent Bestie 💙</div>

		<div class="ps">
			P.S. I Was — And I Still Am — A Hopeless Fan Of Your Smile…<br>
			And Your Cutie Little Eyes That Speak Louder Than Words Ever Could. ☁️👀✨
